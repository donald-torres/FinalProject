# ===Overview===

The app is designed to give homeowners a starring role in either remodeling or refurbishing parts of their home.  Providers(Contractors) are given an opportunity to bid on the jobs posted by the homeowners(Clients).  Homeowners can select from a variety of trades needed per job and the providers can undercut the competition to get the business for themselves. The homeowners have final say on who get selected for the job thus saving themselves money and getting a reputable provider to complete their remodeling or refurbishing.


# Development

The project began on January 24th with planning for what to develop.  A vacuum of sites where people in need of help around the house, but the help would actively vie for your business was identified.  On January 25th we began designing the wireframe and schema mapping out the potential entities we would need for our app.  Once finished we began forming User stories based on the direction our site would be laid out. January 26th marked the beginning of the backend development using SpringToolSuite, once all the entities and JUnit tests were completed we moved to VSCode for the Angular front end development.  From here it was a back and forth from mapping the front end to match the controller routes in the backend. Then getting the information to populate on the frontend, and lastly making it look presentable using CSS or Bootstrap. Once finalized we deployed it using AWS and began bug fixes for our frontend mappings for images.  This project was completed using Git Branching as well as pair programming.
